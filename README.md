# Grocery Tracker Project

Overview

The Grocery Tracker Project is a C++ application designed to help the Corner Grocer analyze their daily sales data. The program reads a text file containing item purchase records, calculates how often each item is sold using a map, and presents the information in both a numeric list and a text-based histogram. A backup file (frequency.dat) is also generated to store the frequency data.

# Project Reflection

# Summary of the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was developed to automate the analysis of grocery sales data. By reading a transaction log and counting the occurrences of each item, the program provides insights that help the store optimize product placement and inventory management. The primary problem solved is the manual effort of counting item sales, which can be error-prone and time-consuming when done by hand.

# What did i do particularly well?
Modular Design: I structured the project into multiple filesâ€”separating class declarations and implementations from the main program logic. This made the code more organized and easier to manage.
Robust File Handling: I implemented error checking for file operations to ensure that missing or inaccessible files are properly handled.
Readable Code: I maintained industry-standard best practices with inline comments, clear variable names, and consistent formatting, making the code easy to understand and maintain.
# How i can improve my code
Advanced Error Handling: Introducing exceptions and logging could make debugging easier and provide more detailed error reports.
Unit Testing: Incorporating automated tests would improve code reliability and facilitate future changes.
User Interface Enhancements: A more interactive or even graphical interface could improve usability, and further refinements could be made for larger datasets.
Security Improvements: While the current project is simple, ensuring proper file permission checks and input validation can safeguard against potential misuse in a production environment.
# what i found the most challenging in this project
File Path Issues: One challenge was ensuring that the program could correctly locate and open the input file. I overcame this by adding debug output to verify the working directory and adjusting the file path accordingly.
Understanding STL Containers: Using maps effectively required careful reading of documentation and examples. I utilized resources like the C++ reference sites and Stack Overflow for best practices.
Maintaining Modularity: Splitting the code into multiple files while keeping them well-connected was a learning process. I refined my approach by studying sample projects and design patterns to ensure clear separation of concerns.
# skills from this project that will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work
C++ Fundamentals: Mastering classes, file I/O, and STL containers (like maps) provides a strong foundation for future C++ programming tasks.
Modular Programming: The ability to organize code into separate, manageable files is crucial for scaling up projects.
Debugging and Testing: Developing a systematic approach to debugging and input validation is valuable in any software development setting.
Documentation and Maintainability: Writing clear, well-documented code ensures that future projects or collaborations can be handled smoothly.
6. How i made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Clear Code Organization: I separated the class declaration (GroceryTracker.h) from its implementation (GroceryTracker.cpp) and kept the main logic in main.cpp, which improves clarity and facilitates future modifications.
Inline Comments and Naming Conventions: Consistent commenting and descriptive variable names make the code self documenting, allowing others (or my future self) to understand the logic quickly.
Scalable Design: By encapsulating the functionality in the GroceryTracker class, the code is modular and can be extended with new features without major refactoring.
